*My favorite part of learning and school has always been applying knowledge learned in one class to understand a subject in another. That is why I chose my major. Biology allows me to learn chemistry, biology, and physics topics that all intertwined with each other. I can apply the synthesis problems that I learned in Organic Chemistry in my Biochemistry class to understand biological processes like cell metabolism. The coding languages of R and Python work in a similar way. This allows for the best things in R to work in Python and vice versa. It allows one coding language to fill in the weaknesses of the other to create a project that is functioning at its fullest potential. Just like taking knowledge from one class and applying it to a topic in another to allow deeper comprehension. For example:*
```{r}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

one<-"I love learning."
```
*The above code is written in R. However, I can use the same function from R in Python like this:*
```{python}
#Python code chunk
two="It helps me understand the world better."
print(r.one,two) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```
*This transfer of information can help researchers, statisticians, and computer programmers a like to complete a specific task. This simple innovation is a prime example of being able to learn from each other and work together to create something FANTASTIC.*
